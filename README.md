My project is all about a smart home trying to automate things in a house the components used are:
Temperature sensor;
resistors;
led lights ;
servo motor;
breadbord;
arduino board;
phototransistors;

The temperature sensor senses the temperature in the room and spins the servo motor depending on the temperature in degrees celcius and when the servomotor spins the fans in the house will be turned on,the phototransistors is used to sense the light intesity in the room and depending on the given output of light intesity in the room it turns on the led lights if lets say its dark the led lights will be turned on and when its bright the led lights will be turned off
